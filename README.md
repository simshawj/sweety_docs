# Sweety

This is my submission for the Sweety code challenge with CodeTheory.  Written in Ruby on Rails utililizing MySQL for the database and tested with rspec and capybara.  Allows users to input their glucose readings up to four times daily in order to be able to track daily and monthly trends.
